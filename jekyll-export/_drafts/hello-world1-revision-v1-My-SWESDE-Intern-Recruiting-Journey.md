47 days. Thatâ€™s how long it took for me from submitting my first application and trying out my first leetcode question to receiving my Amazon SDE Intern offer. It was a surprisingly short journey, I am not going to claim that I have any special advice, and I did not do anything special. There are a million other posts about that already. I just want to share what it feels like to recruit for CS from my perspective, and dump my thoughts here on the way.

Freshman year hopes -&gt; getting disgusted at the state of recruiting (Park, Daniel) -&gt; finding my own reasons for Startups (learning everything/compound interests) -&gt; taking any experience available

Sophomore year -&gt; going all out to try out what I want -&gt; getting a filler role -&gt;

Junior role -&gt; speaking to many mentors and considering the ceiling (Meng Harn/ Daniel/ Kevin) -&gt; going to get an internship

- Seeing someone else get PM, not sure about how I feel. Should I have just gone for it? I knew I could justify whatever place and position I get into? did I do it for the money? did I do it because I want to code and build things?
