# Gratitude

I’ve been feeling a bit unmotivated this past week, although I’ve just had one of the most productive week two weeks ago too.

Recently, I’ve been pretty inspired by Netero from Hunter X Hunter, especially on how his power isn’t derived from pure ambition to better himself, but rather from his gratitude towards martial art. I have heard that gratitude journaling can make you happier, but I never really considered how powerful gratitude is as an motivator. Yes, I want to work out, build BearRoom, and start a successful career because I want money, respect, and ability to make things, and yes, these motivations offer me big bursts of energy, but it’s thinking about my gratitude towards my s/o, my family, and everyone who’s helped me gotten this far that keeps me going. I want to give back and pay it forward, so others can enjoy the same opportunities I’ve had. This is what keeps me going consistently when my bursts of inspirations run out.

# Life Goals

Along that line, I’ve also decided to revisit what I wanted to do with my life, from the longest horizon to the present, to help me get a better sense of what I am doing and why I am doing these things…

## Life

I remember that I’ve always said that I wanted to build technology to improve the quality of lives for people, and to take it one step further (if I don’t end up finding that special something to make), I want to invest in people that build technology to improve the quality of lives for people.

### Why

If you ask me what life should look like 30 years from now, I believe in a world where people don’t have to starve, worry about shelter, and can work for the sake of fulfillment. Idealistic futurists have said that since the beginning of time, and I think we’re making decent progress towards that future. It may be naive for me to think that we’ll ever reach this state of the world, but it’s far more fun to believe and work towards building that future together.

## 20s

I want to make enough money to not worry about money for the rest of my life. To do so, I need to either work at or create a successful startup. At this moment, I plan to work a few years in tech and acquaint myself with like minded people first.

Another strong contender for this is to maximize learning during my 20s since it’s when my brain will peak. Maybe I can go into management/stragey consulting? Product managmenet? I think I will revisit this option come spring quarter.

### Why

It’s not like I ever struggled with money for food/clothing/shelter, but I would much rather be wealthy enough to not have to dedicate any time/effort to ever thinking about these issues. I also want the ability to explore new experiences around the world, and money certainly makes attaining new experiences easier.

## Graduate

I wanna see the world! What for exactly? I am not sure! I certainly want to try a wide range of food, checkout scenic places, and (maybe) explore how innovation and learning looks like across culture.

### Why

WHY NOT? I think just going to see new places and meeting new people will really stimulate my perspective on things and help me solidify my identity and future goals. I also want to just spend some quality time with my S/O before our careers officially start.

## 2022

I want to decide on a career track and land a good job.

### Why

It’ll determine my trajectory for my early 20s, and I can plan on how to leverage this job most effectively to accomplish my later goals

## Winter

I want to get good at writing research style paper and web development and push BearRoom to its very limit.

### Why

I have the perfect courseload (DTR, Agile Development, Data Engineering, Intro to Web Dev) for it. There’s no better time to reflect on how I work and build BearRoom.
