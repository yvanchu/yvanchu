## The Yvan Advantage…

After a lonely pandemic quarter living with my maternal grandfather in Taiwan, I finally started my internship in Taipei and began accepting the possibility of living in Taiwan for a while. I needed to go from surviving remote courses at awkward times to leveraging my unique situation as an unfair advantage.

## 佳馨, 小菜, and the Corner Co-living Family

First major decision I made coming to Taipei was renting in a co-living space rather than a studio apartment. I lived at [Corner Co-living](https://goo.gl/maps/c1Za2Qu2N1VYf3Sq6), which was right next to Taipei Main Station. I’ve first seen the concept of co-living when Joel told me about the Digital Nomad lifestyle, where people do remote work while hopping between countries every few months. I thought this would be the perfect opportunity for me to hang out with a wider range of people, use the fully furnished kitchen, and experience new things.

Two months into living at Corner, I’ve been blessed enough to meet some really great people.

My roommate, Jiaxin, often challenges my thinking and makes me focus on introspective questions regarding my life goals and decision making process. My internal values and thought process has become clearer throughout this past two months.

My housemate, and potentially new roommate, we’ll call him Tsai for now. He’s a hardworking, hands-on, and thoughtful leader, he shows me his mastery in community building through event planning. He provides extreme value to Corner Co-living experience, and is the primary reason I will likely stay in Corner for next quarter. He also cooks and coordinates birthday and farewell parties. Amazing man.

Lulu, the house mascot dog!!! She’s amazing. It’s like having a pet but only keeping the best parts, no weird smell, absolutely adorable, petting and hugging friendly, and no need for maintenance on my end.

Corner co-living is also a great place to work. Michael, our landlord, plays some lofi hip hop or jazz in the living room, and it’s such a chill vibe for working or contemplation. My room is also very minimal and great for deep thoughts as well. The living room is optimal for relaxation, chatting, or low-stress high-productivity work, while my room is great for resting or introspective thinking.

## Nathan, David, and the WhaleTeq Team

Three month internships can get a little dry, but I am working on more UX/learnability topics through redesigning new product interfaces and making tutorial videos, which is really interesting.

Nathan teaches me many entrepreneurial and formal leadership strategies. I really appreciate having a boss like him who I can join breakfast with and talk about tech, market trends, and strategy.

David is my supervisor. He really takes care of me and the rest of the company. He always finds ways to support everyone else, whereas I would just force my way in for the sake of efficiency. He builds a relatively more comfortable path for people and product to grow, whereas I would most likely create discomfort through sheer bluntness and speed.

The WhaleTeq team has really built my confidence up in speaking up and reaching out. Not only did my Chinese get more fluent these past two months, I feel a lot more confident in the workplace and my professional life as well. The people are all super nice, and I am getting better at expressing my ideas as well. Also, the flexibility of the team allows me to seek out new tools to optimize my workflow.

## Northwestern and its related resources

With better introspective clarity and confidence in communication, I’m more prone to seeking mentorship and networking opportunities through Northwestern now. I am very thankful for the abundant resources available at Northwestern that synergizes with my more aggressive approach towards life planning and advice seeking.

This summarizes my distinct advantages throughout this summer. Hoping to grow even more next month around.
